# Dart 
Dart is an object-oriented, class-based programming language developed by Google. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use for building web and mobile applications. Dart is an open-source project with a growing community of contributors.
This course is designed for programmers who have never programmed in Dart and want to get started with Flutter.

We will teach you Dart from the ground up; going over everything you need to know to write a basic program assuming you have no prior knowledge of the language. The course will also go over programming concepts found in multiple languages. Some concepts you might already be familiar with, but we will assume that you arenâ€™t.
